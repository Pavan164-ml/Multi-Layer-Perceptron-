# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# 1. Create a separate config file that should contain all the parameters used in the model such as Epoch, learning rate, etc.
# 2. Keep the path to save a model in the config file.
# 3. This config file can be of type YAML, JSON, or a PYTHON file. It's your choice.
